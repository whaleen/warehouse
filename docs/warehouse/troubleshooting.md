# Troubleshooting

## GPS Issues
- **"GPS unavailable"**: enable location services and allow browser permissions.
- **Inaccurate markers**: GPS can be off indoors; use map markers as a general area.

## Scanner Issues
- **Camera scanner not working**: grant camera permission and improve lighting.
- **Model scan rejected**: use a Scanning Session for model‑only scans (feature in development).

## Inventory Gaps
- **Item not found**: it may not be synced from GE DMS yet.
- **Map shows nothing**: item must be scanned at least once to appear.

## Load Prep
- **Sold load missing prep flags**: update wrap/tag and sanity check in the load detail panel.
