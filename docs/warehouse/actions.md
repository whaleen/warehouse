# Action Items

## What Actions Are
The Actions page prioritizes work based on load status, prep flags, pickup dates, and scanning sessions.

## Action Types
- **Sanity check** requests
- **Prep** tasks (wrap/tag)
- **Pickup‑soon** prep
- **Scanning sessions** in progress

## Filters
Use the tabs to filter the list:
- **All**
- **Critical** (critical/high urgency)
- **Scans** (session work)
- **Prep** (wrap/tag/pickup prep)

## What Happens When You Click
Selecting an action opens the related load detail so you can complete the work.

## Audience Notes

### For Developers
- Actions derive from load status + sessions.

### For Operators
- Use Actions to see priority prep and scan tasks.

### For Agent
- Use Actions to answer “what should I do next”.
