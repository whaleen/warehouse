# Scanning Sessions

## Current UI Status
There is no standalone Scanning Sessions page in the app UI. Session tracking runs behind the Map scanner.

## What Sessions Are
Scanning Sessions are batch workflows used by the scanner to group work and track progress.

## When Sessions Apply
- Scanning all items in a sub‑inventory
- Physical inventory counts

## Start Scanning
1. Open **Warehouse Map**.
2. Click **Scan**.
3. Use **Fog of War** or **Ad‑hoc** to log scans.

## During a Session
- Scan items with keyboard or camera
- Progress shows X / Y scanned
- Close the session when done

## Key Notes
- Sessions are managed automatically by the scanner

## Audience Notes

### For Developers
- Sessions are scanner-managed; no dedicated UI page.

### For Operators
- Use the Map scanner; there is no Sessions page.

### For Agent
- Do not mention Sessions page; reference Map scanner.
