# Loads

## What Loads Are
Loads group items by sub‑inventory. ASIS loads are tracked with GE status fields and prep flags.

## Load List
1. Open **Loads** from the sidebar.
2. Use the filter chips to switch between:
   - **All**
   - **For Sale**
   - **Picked**
   - **Shipped**
   - **Delivered**
3. Use **Show delivered** to include delivered loads.

## Load Detail Panel
Click a load to open its detail panel. It includes:
- Load header and status badges
- Item list with search (serial, CSO, model, brand)
- Per‑item status markers
- Load metadata fields (friendly name, color, notes)
- Prep flags (wrapped, tagged, sanity check requested/completed)
- Pickup date

## Common Tasks
- **Update prep status** for sold loads before pickup.
- **Request or complete sanity check** when GE asks for verification.
- **Edit friendly name or color** for on‑floor identification.

## Notes
- Delivered loads are hidden by default.
- Shipped loads can still be on the floor (sold awaiting pickup).

## Audience Notes

- Loads map to sub-inventory and GE load metadata.
