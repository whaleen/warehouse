# Dashboard

## What It Is
The Dashboard provides a high‑level overview of inventory totals, load status, scanning progress, and recent activity.

## What You Can Do
- View totals by inventory type (ASIS, FG, Local Stock)
- See load counts by status (for sale, sold, prep needs)
- Drill into inventory or loads from the summary cards
- Review recent activity entries

## Navigation Shortcuts
Dashboard cards link into:
- **Inventory** (pre‑filtered by type)
- **Loads** (specific load detail)
- **Activity** (full log)

## Audience Notes

### For Developers
- Dashboard is summary-only, not the source of truth.

### For Operators
- Use Dashboard for high-level counts and links.

### For Agent
- Avoid detailed data claims; point to Inventory/Loads.
