# Warehouse App

## Purpose
The Warehouse app helps scan items, track inventory, and visualize last‑scanned locations on the map.

## Core Areas
- **Inventory**: Search items by serial, CSO, model, or product type.
- **Scanning**: Record GPS locations for items using ad‑hoc scans or session scanning.
- **Scanning (Map)**: Use the Map scan overlay for ad‑hoc and Fog of War scans.
- **Warehouse Map**: Visualize scan points as markers on a blank canvas.

## When to Use Each Area
- Use **Inventory** to find a specific item or verify details.
- Use **Scanning** to record or update GPS locations.
- Use **Scanning (Map)** for batch scanning; there is no separate Sessions page.
- Use **Warehouse Map** to see where items were last scanned.
